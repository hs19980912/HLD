CAP: Desirable property of distributed system with Replicated data.

C: Consistency
A: Availability             All the DB nodes should atleast respond.
                            The response can be anything: Sucess/Faliure
P: Partition Tolerance      In a distributed system, the user should be able to QUERY 
                            even when there is a communition breakage between nodes.
                            Even in the case of partition, system should be UP.
                        

The distributed system should always be Partition Tolerant.

We should always try to compromise with Consistency or availability if possible.
